Recently I read "How to win friends and influence people" by Dale Carnegie, and this book answers the need of many people: What do adults really want to study? Is it mathematics, is it psychology? None of these. After health topics, it is to learn to develop skills in human relationships, in an easy way with examples and concrete action. And that is exactly what this book from Mr Carnegie is doing.

This book gives you 6 ways to make people like you, 12 ways to win people to your way of thinking, and 9 ways to change people without arousing resentment. All these ways are provided with examples of stories from his students or people he knew.

What I found great is that, although it is really applicable to sales in general, I found and Mr Carnegie said it by himself, these tricks that he is giving are, first, not magical, as they won't work 100% of the time, but if you make them work maybe 10% of the time, you will be 10% managing better your relationships, and also it requires a genuine mindset and a true interest.

I want to highlight each of these ways with a punchline or a good example. So here we go.

6 ways to make people like you

1 Become genuinely interested in other people
You can make more friends in two months by becoming genuinely interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get people interested by you.
We are interested in others when they are interested in us.

2 Smile

3 Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.
Good things to do for this one is to learn how to pronounce well the name of a foreign person for example. I found it very bad to make fun of the pronunciation, or the unknown sounds.

4 Be a good listener, encourage others to talk about themselves.

5 Talk in terms of the other person's interests.

6 Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely.
