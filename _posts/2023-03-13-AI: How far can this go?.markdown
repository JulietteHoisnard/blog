The scope of AI:

- Industry 4.0, which is the combination of IoT technologies and AI, the manufacturing processes are becoming smarter and more efficient, which in the end should boost productivity and revenue.
- Digital art: Photos, images, videos, music, writing, can be generated from a sentence description and a few parameters in many cases. What is funny (not so much in the end), is that if you asked people ten years ago about how AI is gonna have an impact, first it's gonna come for production site manual jobs (for example robots which are feeding components for PCB(printed circuit board) assembly), then it will come to low skilled jobs like catering jobs, then it will come to take high-qualified jobs like developers, engineering, research, and last it will reach the creative jobs. But exactly the opposite is happening, with creative jobs being the first jobs taken down by AI!
