I found very helpful shortcuts in Visual Studio Code so here they are:

- Ctrl + . => Fix issues menu appears ( example: solve EsLint issues)
- Ctrl + Shift + K => Delete one line
- Ctrl + Alt + Down/Up => Duplicate the selected line
- Alt + Down/Up => Move the line Up or Down
- Ctrl + ` => Open a terminal / Cursor goes into terminal area
- Ctrl + 1 => Cursor goes into coding area
- F2 => Rename everywhere the selected variable
- Ctrl + space => import functions/components in React
- Alt + Shift + Left/Right => select element to select parent
