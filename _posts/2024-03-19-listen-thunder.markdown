When I want to fully concentrate and escape the noise around me I enjoy listening to thunderstorms or rain "music". It has the power to cut all the noise around you, especially conversations, and you are sometimes being awaken by a striking sound of lightning. Plus I thin, and it is proven to be a very productive background noise, because on a rainy day you don't want to find yourself outside under the storm, you want to be comfy in your interior and focus on important and personal tasks. So for coding, it is a perfect atmosphere!
