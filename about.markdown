Hi, I'm Juliette! I'm French and I have been living in Berlin for 4 years now. Before moving to Berlin, I was working as a Quality Project Engineer for a worldwide automotive supplier. I was a bit fed up with this world and decided to change to become a software engineer. I enrolled in the bootcamp Le Wagon in Berlin in 2020, and I am now an accomplished fullstack developer! I went through many ways of working during this professionnal transition: as a freelancer at the beginning and fully-remote, then in a small berliner agency, and now as an IT Consultant.

Other than that,I am a passionate cyclist and dancer. I love Berlin, especially for cycling around. A fun fact is that I started road cycling because every sport and dance studios were closed due to Corona crisis when I arrived in Berlin in 2020. I did 5000km in 2022 and 2023 and 2 main cyclign events, Velocity in Berlin (38km/h on 120km) and l'Etape du Tour de France in the Alps (11hours, 4700m meters high and 170km). I'm also a dance addict, from salsa to ballet, but currently I'm turning more and more into aerial sports like Pole Dance and aerial hoop / silks, as well as over-streching in contorsion classes.
